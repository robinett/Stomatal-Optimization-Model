# Stomatal-Optimization-Model
Novel stomatal Optimization model including plant storage

Folder "Idealized Model" contains the model as it was developed on idealized data.

Folder: "Model Testing, Anderegg et al. 2018" contains the model as it was adapted to test against the leaf gas exchange dataset developed in Anderegg et al. 2018 "Woody plants optimize stomatal behavior relative to hydraulic risk."

Folder: "Model Testing, Duke Forest" contains the model as it was adapted to test against the sapflow dataset collected at the Duke Forest CO2 experiments. This is the final version of the model.
